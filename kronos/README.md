# kronos
YEAR: September-2020
PURPOSE: My first Flutter application. A simple chronometer with some animations added. Uses a "ticker" stream with a StreamSubscription that sends a value every second to handle the flow of time. This project is not to be seen as an example of good practices but rather as a starting point to understand how the framework operates.

NOTES: the apk is available in: ./build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
